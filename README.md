# rw_tileman

a utility meant for Rain World region modders. should make managing large tile libraries less of a mess.

features:

- tile subfolders 
- toggling tiles/categories
- previewing geometry (wip)


TODO (maybe):

- remove the need for comments to store state (mostly done)
- rearrange UI (tiles panel to left, resizing tiles panel Actually Works)
- checkboxes for all items (unchecking category with no subfolder creates one automatically)
- category order changes via dragging rather than buttons

dream features that may never happen:

- Props Manager
- syncing between multiple init files
- fully functional init editor
- online browser\uploader??
